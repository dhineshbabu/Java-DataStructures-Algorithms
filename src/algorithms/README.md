### Problem Solving Techniques
<hr/>
<hr/>

### Recursion
<hr/>

* base case for breaking the recursive calls else Stackoverflow error
* factorial, fibonacci series and many more problems can be simplified with recursion

### Binary Search Tree with Recursion
<hr/>

* rInsert()
* rDeleteNode()
* fre helper methods
* BFS - Traversing at each level of the tree
* DFS - Traversing until leaf node and then come up and iterate
  * pre-order - (parent, left, right)
  * in-order - (left, right, parent)
  * post-order - (left, parent, right)

### Binary Search Tree with Recursion
<hr/>

* Bubble sort - O(n^2)
* Selection sort - having minIndex and replace with sorted area
  * - O(n^2)
* Insertion sort - loop starts from 1
  * - O(n^2)
* Merge sort
  * Need Merge helper
  * Breaks array in half
  * Base case: when array.length is 1
  * Uses merge() to put arrays together
  * space - O(1)
  * time complexity - O(nlogn)
* Quick Sort
  * Need a pivot point
